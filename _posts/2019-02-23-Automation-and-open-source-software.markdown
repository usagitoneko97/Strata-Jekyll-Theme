Technology has come a long way. But most people does not utilize the available technologies, whether or not it's about work or just personal stuff. It really should blame on major OSes like Windows and mac that are targetted to the average users, users that are expecting OSes that 'just works'--also the tagline for Apple. Because of this nature, these propietary OSes won't expose every component to the user and only left out what users wanted to see. Is it easy for non-technological savvy
person to familiarize Windows? Yes. Can you make use of the available functionalities of Windows and perform automation to its full potential? Maybe if you invest all your time.

A lot of times where you need to perform tasks that are not provided by Windows machine, and that forces you to install 3rd party software application that most probably have ads that requires you to pay for getting rid of it. This is propietary software and it's their business model. Open source software on the other hand would not never have ads, and would always free, as in price and freedom.

If you notice carefully, there are tons of stuff that you do in your computer that are repetitive in nature. Example where you need to bulk rename files. Windows and Macos wouldn't let you do more advance stuff to that extent. 

Perhaps whoever reading this would start to imagine what is the future of our technologies, and the first thing that come out is AI. You will start to imagine somewhere in the future where simple voice command like 'Hey Siri, move all text file to Documents and image file to Picture folder' will save you few of the clicks. We are most likely will be blessed by technology features such as this not far from now. But little that we know 20/30 years ago it's already available in UNIX machine.

```bash
mv *.txt ~/Documents && mv *.jpg ~/Pictures
```
Point is, there are lots of automation opportunities for your everyday tasks, you just have to keep an eye on it.
