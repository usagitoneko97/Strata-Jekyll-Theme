It's an important day for Meliz. The lights around stared at her nakedly, exposing her every layer of anxiety. She slowly come to sense, raising her weak and shivering arms to her abdoment area, feeling the emptiness that had once housed a ball of excitement. The door swung open, a man with long, brown and feminine hair with a brown moustache walked in, carrying a baby wrapped in a white towel. Time is simply a 4th-dimension concept that she seems to forgot, as the only sound matters in that moment is the crying of the little ball, now flailing his arms all over, unintelligibly.

Slowly and gently Meliz put her hand over the baby, caressing with such care that as though as a slight pressure will immediately shattering it into pieces. The man deliberately clear his throat, attempting to restore the forgotten concept of time. After thirteen inches has passed for Meliz, she regained her sense and fixed her eyes on the man, waiting for his relevation.

"Errrr, I'm so sorry Meliz, but you know, I need to tell you something. I didn't like to do this but here we go. ", said the man scratching his bearded chin. After he sigh a deep and sorrowful sigh, he continued.
"From this moment forth, and for the rest of your childâ€™s entire life, he will repeatedly and routinely lapse into a state of apparent coma. It might even resemble death at times. And while his body lies still his mind will often be filled with stunning, bizarre hallucinations. This state will consume one-third of his life."

"It's called sleep.", the god concluded.

Do you ever wonder why we human sleep, as though million and million years of evolution doesn't even bother to fix it. 8 hours daily of vulnerability will surely put our ancestors in a great trouble. They must be several good reasons for why our god (or rather, science if you are an atheist) gifted us the ability to sleep.

There's a lot of documented and confirmed benefits of sleep, to name a few, psychological health, emotional relief, learning, stable mental strength are all benefits obtained from a good sleep. But up until this point, scientist weren't able to tell you the complete answer to the reason why we sleep. The sections below will reveal the different truth about sleep, how it is infinitely more complex, profoundly more interesting, and alarmingly more health-relevant.

# The sleep rhythm
It's 12 a.m., I'm sitting straight, staring fixately into the monitor screen writing an article about why we sleep, with the deadline creeping nearer for every second passed, and constant battling with the urge to sleep. Why do my body behave this way? With 0 respect to my will of not getting in the bed. There are mainly two players in our body directing our sleep/wake cycle. The first fact is that there is a signal beamed out from your internal twenty-four-hour clock located deep within
your brain, which is called **circadian rhythm**. The rhythm will, never apply leave for a single day, help regulates your tiredness or alertness at fixed regular times. 

Interesting enough, circadian rhythm does not have any relationship with the sunlight. Throw a person into a cave with no light penetrating, he/she will still be able to sleep at a regular interval. Circadian rhythm is also the culprit for the most common problem during travelling -- jet lag. Travelling to other continent will messed up the internal rhythm since night/day length is different before and after arriving. 

The second factor is a chemical substance that builds up in your brain and creates a "sleep pressure," and is commonly known as **adenosine**. As you wake up in the morning and proceed through the day, adenosine will accumulate in the receptor area, the more it is, the sleepy you'll be. At the end of the day, the adenosine collected will be at the all time high, coupled with the declining circadian rhythm you'll feel the overwhelming urge to sleep.

Once you begin your sweet dreams, the cleaning aunty in your brain will help purge all adenosine away, thus preparing you for a fresh day when you wake up. The low level adenosine coupled with high intensity of circadian rhythm will make you feel all-time fresh. 

But what will happen if there are still adenosine leftover? (i.e. not enough sleep). You'll of course feel sleepy and lots of people will consume caffeine -- which will help block the receptors, thus merely just delaying the building of adenosine since adenosine will continue to be release. Once the effect of caffeine gets weaker, the no-where-to-go adenosine will rush towards the receptor area, which will hit you like a truck.

Now as I'm finishing up my pieces, the sun is already beaming at me. I've overcome the pressure to sleep and managed to pull an all-nighter. After I've published my article, the overpowering sleepiness that I experienced during the night seems to be dissapearing. I've had the energy to gather myself to go and watch "cats" alone (since someone rejected me.) The reason is not because "cats" is interesting enough to chase away all those sleepiness, but rather the effects of circadian
rhythm kicking in for the rescue. Circadian rhythm wouldn't take into account whether you have slept or not, or the level of the adenosine. The two factors are totally independent of each other. Keep in mind that adenosine will still keep building up, and by the end of the night, I will feel the effect like getting hit by 2 trucks.
