It's an important day for Meliz. The lights around stared at her nakedly, exposing her every layer of anxiety. She slowly come to sense, raising her weak and shivering arms to her abdoment area, feeling the emptiness that had once housed a ball of excitement. The door swung open, a man with long, brown and feminine hair with a brown moustache walked in, carrying a baby wrapped in a white towel. Time is simply a 4th-dimension concept that she seems to forgot, as the only sound matters in that moment is the crying of the little ball, now flailing his arms all over, unintelligibly.

Slowly and gently Meliz put her hand over the baby, caressing with such care that as though as a slight pressure will immediately shattering it into pieces. The man deliberately clear his throat, attempting to restore the forgotten concept of time. After thirteen inches has passed for Meliz, she regained her sense and fixed her eyes on the man, waiting for his relevation.

"Errrr, I'm so sorry Meliz, but you know, I need to tell you something. I didn't like to do this but here we go. ", said the man scratching his heavily bearded chin. After he sigh a deep and sorrowful sigh, he continued.
"From this moment forth, and for the rest of your childâ€™s entire life, he will repeatedly and routinely lapse into a state of apparent coma. It might even resemble death at times. And while his body lies still his mind will often be filled with stunning, bizarre hallucinations. This state will consume one-third of his life."

"It's sleep.", the god concluded.

Do you ever wonder why we human sleep, as though as million and million years of evolution doesn't even bother to fix it. 8 hours of invulnerability will put our ancestors in a great trouble. They must be a reason for why god (or rather, science if you are atheist) created us this way.
